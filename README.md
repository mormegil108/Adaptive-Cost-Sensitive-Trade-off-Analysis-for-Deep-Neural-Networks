# Adaptive-Cost-Sensitive-Trade-off-Analysis-for-Deep-Neural-Networks
This repository includes the analysis and report of a deep learning study created for a master's course named Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks at Ozyegin University. The study aims to introduce a new cost-sensitive loss function that can handle imbalanced datasets in computer vision practices.
