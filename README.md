# Adaptive-Cost-Sensitive-Trade-off-Analysis-for-Deep-Neural-Networks
This repository includes the analysis and report of a deep learning study created for a master's course named Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks at Ozyegin University.
ABSTRACT:
Imbalanced datasets complicate the accuracy of classification in machine learning. Image classification models, which include many crucial tasks such as cancer detection, and object detection in the securities industry, are prone to suffer from such datasets. To that end, this study aims to discover different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models applied to three image datasets and obtain the following results: (1) By applying hyperparameter tuning to the ANN models and pre-processing the datasets, competitive baseline results will be obtained for each model. (2) Using the available literature to comprehend the existing-cost sensitive lost functions, this study will introduce a new loss function to deal with the misclassification of the imbalanced dataset and test its feasibility over the basic and advanced functions that exist in the literature. After completing the analysis, the results suggested that the introduced cost functions did not improve classification accuracy. However, the authors plan to advance the analysis with different cost-sensitive loss functions in future work, given the minor improvements.
